<p id="description">This Python script creates an animated fidget spinner using the Turtle graphics library. The code produces an interactive graphical spinner that rotates and changes colors. Users can accelerate the spinner by pressing the spacebar. The spinner's animation and interaction are achieved by manipulating the Turtle graphics and updating the screen at regular intervals. It provides a fun and engaging visualization of a spinning fidget toy.</p>
